One of the things that I've thought about, and am not 100% on yet, is collecting the "Gift Sets" that you can find from Jack Daniel's. They are typically a bottle of Old No. 7, or Fire, or Honey and come with some form of glassware. There seems to be a new set every season, if not more frequent than that. Do I need/want to have boxes of shot glasses and rocks glasses around?

I haven't quite decided on the answer to that question yet, but I do have a few that I need to document, so here goes one.

Here is a Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire Gift Set with 2 Shot Glasses. 

The shot glasses are black with red graphics. 

The side of the box read:

> It takes a fire to make Jack, and Jack to make fire
> Best served scorching cold

The back of the box reads:

> Our Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire blends red-hot cinnamon liqueur with the smooth character of Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 for a classic spirit with spicy finish.

>Just pour Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire fresh from the freezer into a shot glass.

> Do't get burned. Drink responsibly.

The bottle is a previous generation Tennessee Fire Bottle, reading Original Recipe on the front, instead of the current (2020) Cinnamon Spice label.
