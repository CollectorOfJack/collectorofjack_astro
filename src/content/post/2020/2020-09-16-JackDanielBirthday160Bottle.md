In 2010, the Jack Daniel's distillery released a beautiful black bottle for Jack Daniel's 160th birthday. No one is actually sure what day in the month of September is his actual birthday, so they celebrate all month long in Lynchburg Tennessee. The bottle came with a black box, both adorned in white silver and red accents.

I figured September 2020 was a good time to post this! We're halfway through the month of September, so Happy Birthday Jasper Newton Daniel!

## 160th Birthday Bottle and Box
The front of the box and bottle read:
> Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 Brand
> Mr. Jack's 160th Birthday 1850 to 2010
> Sour Mash Tennessee Whiskey

The back of the box and side of the bottle read: 
> Jasper Newton "Jack" Daniel 1580 to 2010
> How do we honor Mr. Jack's 160th Birthday? The same way we honor him every day of the year. All Jack ever asked was "Every day we make it we make it the best that we can." HE was talking about his whiskey, of course. So we honor hyim on thi birthday by making good on his request with the bottle you now hold.

## 160th Birthday Hang Tag
There is black and red hang tag included with the bottle as well that reads:
> We're proud to honor Mr. Jack Daniel of Lynchburg, Tennessee, on his 160th Birthday. Who would have guessed this man who stood just 5'2" tall would grow in international stature and be celebrated today in more than 135 countries? It's a testament to Mr. Jack's dedication and craft as a whiskey maker, and we hope you'll join us in raising a glass to his life and his life's work. Here's to Jack.



## The Bottle
The bottle itself is adorned with a black label, and a black/red tax stamp recreation. As far as I am aware, this is the first black bottle from Jack Daniel's, and not seen in the United States again until the 2020 Eric Church single barrel release. There was a 161st birthday bottle, with square corners, released in the UK in 2011. The bottle is the older familiar rounded corner design. There is also rumors that it was available in a 1L size in some states, but I haven't seen that with my own eyes.

You can find the bottle online, listed around $570 as of September 2020.
