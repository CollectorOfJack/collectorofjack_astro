For the past two years, Jack Daniel's Special Release has been the Heritage barrel bottles (covered [here](/HeritageBarrel2019) and [here](/HeritageBarrel)).

For 2020 they have announced the Special Release as the Barrel Proof Rye bottle, pictured here. We don't have a lot of details on them yet, but hope to find out when/where you can get them soon!
