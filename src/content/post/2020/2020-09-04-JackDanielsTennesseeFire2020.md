Somehow I haven't blogged about the Jack Daniel's Tennessee Fire, and here we are with a second iteration of the bottle already! Maybe soon we'll get some pictures of the original bottle, for now we'll cover the newly designed bottle that was released in 2019 and most markets in 2020.

Tennessee Fire was the second offering of flavored liqueurs from Jack Daniel's, first was Honey, and third was Tennessee Apple.

## Changes from the Original Recipe
This bottle is different from the original Cinnamon Fire release, the color of the label has changed, and the wording Original Recipe has been replaced with Cinnamon Spice.

## Front Label
The label on the bottle is red, with gold and black trim, along with white and gold text. 

> Jack Daniel's Cinnamon Spice  
> Tennessee Fire  
> Finely Crafted  
> Cinnamon Liqueur  
> Blended with Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey  


## Side Labels
> Jack Daniel's Character  
> Lynchburg, Tenn  
> Spiced Cinnamon  
> Warm Finish  
> Exceptionally Smooth  
> Highest Quality  
>  
> Bold Flavor  
> Our Tennessee Fire has the distinctive taste of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and the Warmth of Cinnamon for a unique and rewarding taste.  
> Enjoy Chilled  

## Tennessee Fire Thoughts
If you haven't tried Tennessee Fire, you should. It's hot, cinnamon, but worth a taste. I prefer it straight, though chilling it before consumption, or with some ice works as well.

You can find it at most retailers, nothing special about it from a purchasing perspective.
