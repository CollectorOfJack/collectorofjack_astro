For 2022 Jack Daniel's announced, and released, two new expressions. Both of these are released in a 700ml (and also a 1L version). The word on these releases is that they will be available regularly going forward, and are not limited releases like the 10 Year and Heritage barrels released over the last few years (more of those coming however).

The first bottle we covered was [Jack Daniel's Bottled-In-Bond Tennessee Whiskey](/JackDanielsBondedTennesseeWhiskey). 

The second bottle is Jack Daniel's Triple Mash Blended Straight Whiskey.

This release is also Bottled in Bond, which means it was distilled in one season, aged a minimum of 4 years in a government bonded warehouse, with no removal or addition of materials besides water for proofing and it must also be bottled at 100 proof.

[From the Jack Daniel's Website](https://www.jackdaniels.com/en-us/whiskey/triple-mash):
> Jack Daniel’s Triple Mash is a Bottled-in-Bond whiskey, which must be distilled by a single distiller during a single distillation season, matured in a government bonded warehouse for at least four years, and bottled at 100 proof.  Barrels are hand-selected for their characteristics of deeper color, flavor, and aroma, which deliver a darker, richer, and more oak-forward character. It’s a big, bold Tennessee Whiskey at 100 proof with layered notes of caramel, rich oak, and spice giving way to a pleasantly lingering finish..

The front of the bottle reads:
> Neck Label: 100 Proof  
> Label: Jack Daniel's Triple Mash Blended Straight Whiskey
> A blend of bonded american malt, rye and Tennessee whiskeys
> Bottled-in-bond - 100 Proof  
> Made in Tennessee / Bottled At The Distillery  
> Bottle: Jack Daniel Distillery DSP-TN-1 Tennessee  

The side labels read:
> Right Side: Distilled and bottled by Jack Daniel Distillery Lynchburg, Tenn. USA
Est & Reg. in 1866 DSP TN-1 DSP TN-4  
> Left Side: Triple Mash. A blend of three bonded whiskeys with pleasant notes of Honey, Malt, & Soft Oaky leading to a long lasting well rounded finish.  
> Bottled-In-Bond Distilled by a single distiller, during a single season & matured in a government bonded warehouse for at least 4 years  
> 100 Proof  

The rear of the bottled, in raised letters, reads:
> Established & Registered 1866  
> Jack Daniel Distillery DSP-TN-1 Tennessee  

I found this bottle at Dogwood Wine and Spirits in Ellisville, Missouri towards the end of May 2022. The price was great at under $40. I haven't been out hunting too much lately, but I haven't found it again on the shelves in St. Louis yet.

**Release:** 2022  
**Proof:** 100  
**Size:** 700ml
