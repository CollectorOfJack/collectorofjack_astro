For 2022 Jack Daniel's announced, and released, two new expressions. Both of these are released in a 700ml (and also a 1L version). The word on these releases is that they will be available regularly going forward, and are not limited releases like the 10 Year and Heritage barrels released over the last few years (more of those coming however).

The first bottle we'll cover is the new Jack Daniel's Bonded Tennessee Whiskey. The release is in a bottle styled after early Jack Daniel's bottles, with raised letters in the bottles which we'll document below. The labels are minimal, creating a beautiful bottle that will look great in your collection.

This release is Bottled in Bond, which means it was distilled in one season, aged a minimum of 4 years in a government bonded warehouse, with no removal or addition of materials besides water for proofing and it must also be bottled at 100 proof.

[From the Jack Daniel's Website](https://www.jackdaniels.com/en-us/whiskey/bonded-experience):
> Jack Daniel’s Bonded is a Bottled-in-Bond whiskey, which must be distilled by a single distiller during a single distillation season, matured in a government bonded warehouse for at least four years, and bottled at 100 proof.  Barrels are hand-selected for their characteristics of deeper color, flavor, and aroma, which deliver a darker, richer, and more oak-forward character. It’s a big, bold Tennessee Whiskey at 100 proof with layered notes of caramel, rich oak, and spice giving way to a pleasantly lingering finish.

The front of the bottle reads:
> Neck Label: 100 Proof  
> Label: Jack Daniel's Bonded Tennessee Whiskey  
> Aged in select barrels for added depth and character  
> Bottled-in-bond - 100 Proof  
> Made in Tennessee / Bottled At The Distillery  
> Bottle: Jack Daniel Distillery DSP-TN-1 Tennessee  

The side labels read:
> Right Side: Distilled and bottled by Jack Daniel Distillery Lynchburg, Tenn. USA
Est & Reg. in 1866 DSP TN-1 DSP TN-4  
> Left Side: Bonded is a big, bold Tennesse whiskey with layered notes of Caramel, Rich Oak, & Spice Giving way to a pleasantly lingering finish  
> Bottled-In-Bond Distilled by a single distiller, during a single season & matured in a government bonded warehouse for at least 4 years  
> 100 Proof  

The rear of the bottled, in raised letters, reads:
> Established & Registered 1866  
> Jack Daniel Distillery DSP-TN-1 Tennessee  

I ended up picking up two bottles of this in Oklahoma City in early May 2022. Since then I have found it in St. Louis as well. It will be interesting to see how long these stays in stock, and how frequently the shelves are restocked. At the $35 price point, it should be very interesting in the whiskey/bourbon space!
