For the past 6 or 9 months, there has been a Jack Daniel's Facebook Group [Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tennesseewhiskey) that has been controlled at first by someone in Vietnam, and then someone in another part of Asia, that has simply put, been over run by scammers and frauds.

Upwards of 50 times a day, there would be posts, mostly from accounts outside of the United States (that's not to say there are not Jack Daniel's fans all around the world) that were basically trying to scam people into paying for T-Shirts that would never get sent, or scam them to pay for bottles of various whiskeys and other things that would never actually ship.

Spam, spam, spam.

Lots of it. No matter how much you reported the group to Facebook, or how much you reported the group to the Admin(s) it wouldn't stop.

Well, I have put a stop to it. (At least I am attempting to). I have managed to talk my way into becoming the sole admin of the group, and I've spent quite a bit of time over the last 24 hours cleaning it up.

Deleting posts, blocking authors, removing comments, setting up automated rules, to try to prevent additional spam from infiltrating the group.

There are currently 21k members in the group. How many of those are fraudulent accounts? I can't say for sure. But I can tell you, there are real accounts in there, and they love Jack Daniel's, and they love sharing, discussing, and commenting on posts.

We will clean this up. We will make it better. 

If you're on Facebook, come on over and check the group out.

While I am the sole admin right now, I have no visions of trying to maintain a firm grasp that only I control. I will be working on setting up additional moderators and such in the group to help keep it clean, useful, and fun.

If you're looking for a place to buy/sell whiskey, this is not the group for you. This is a place to talk about Jack Daniel's and other Tennessee Whiskey, so grab a drink, have a seat, and stay for a while.
