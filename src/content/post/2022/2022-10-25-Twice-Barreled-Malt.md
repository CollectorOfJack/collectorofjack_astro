The 2022 Special Release for Jack Daniel's should be hitting shelves very soon! We don't have a bottle yet, but wanted to highlight what you can expect!

Jack Daniel's Twice Barreled Special Release American Single Malt, an Oloroso sherry-finished whiskey made from 100% malted barley

> This special release series highlights the Jack Daniel Distillery's innovation. Crafted from 100% malted barley, matured first in new American charred oak barrels and then in the finest Oloroso sherry casks, we extend this one-of-a-kind craftsmanship to you.

What is Oloroso Sherry?
>Oloroso Sherry Cask are whisky casks which have been previously held Oloroso Sherry. Oloroso Sherry is a type of fortified wine produced near the city of Jerez de la Frontera in Andalusia, Spain. The Sherry Triangle produces wines which have been 'fortified' with a higher alcohol strength in order to prevent yeast growth and bottled under the official name of Jerez-Xérès-Sherry. There is something of a manufactured misconception, that the casks used at these bodegas are the same used for whisky maturation however this is not the case. Oloroso sherry casks are more commonly known as sherry butts within the whisky industry. - [WhiskeyPedia](https://whiskipedia.com/fundamentals/oloroso-sherry-casks/)
