The Jack Daniel's Scenes from Lynchburg Series is a collection of 8 bottles, released every year from 2003 to 2011 (skipping 2010). Each bottle features a picture on the front depicting a scene from Lynchburg, Tennessee, the home of the Jack Daniel's Distillery.

I have/had a few bottles from the series that I picked up at the Distillery on a couple of different trips. I ended up trading one of the bottles in 2020 for the Before and After set from the distillery, but I took pictures of it before trading and will post about it later.

The first bottle I picked up was Scenes From Lynchburg Number Five, released in 2007. 

The front of the bottle features a picture of the Jack Daniel statue at the cave spring in Lynchburg. The current statue was put in place in 2000 and can be found all over social media as people post for pictures next to Jack.

#### The front of the bottle reads:

> Jack Daniel's
> Old No. 7 Brand
> Jack Daniel Tennessee Whiskey

#### The neck label reads: 

> Jack Daniel Scenes From Lynchburg

#### The back of the bottle reads

> Jack Daniel's
> Scenes from Lynchburg Number Five
> This is the fifth in a series of bottles depicting life in Lynchburg, Tennessee, home of the Jack Daniel Distillery. When it came to making this Tennessee Whiskey, Jack Daniel was rock-solid in his determination to make it the best he could. This 600-pound bronze statue of Mr. Jack is a reminder of his commitment. Sculpted by an artist from Nashville, it has been standing guard in front of the distillery's cave spring since September 2000, which happens to have been Mr. Jack's 150th birthday. It replaced the original marple statue that stood there for nearly 60 years, which is now located inside the Distillery's Visitor Center.

The sides of this bottle are blank, with no label or printing on either side of the side of the neck. 

Finding this bottle online isn't easy, I found it online in one location for nearly $1,000. 

In the United States the bottle was released as a 750ml bottle at 86 proof. In Europe I believe there was a 1 liter version, and in Canada it was proofed at 80.
