In 2018 the Boston Red Sox won the MLB World Series. Jim Beam released a bottle celebrating this and I was fortunate enough to have a family member in massachusetts pick one up for me. I'm a HUGE Red Sox fan, always have been, even went to Game 4 of the 2004 World Series to see them win their first Championship in 86 years, so getting my hands on this bottle was exciting. For some reason I never got around to posting about it though, even though I took the pictures for it back in 2019!

I don't have a whole lot of info on release for this bottle, I'm guessing it was limited to New England, but I don't know how limited it was. A quick search online doesn't return many results.

#### The front of the bottle reads:

> The World's No. 1 Bourbon Whiskey
> Jim Beam
> Limited Edition Championship Batch
> 2018 World Champions
> Barrels Matured During Game 5 / October 28th 2018
> Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey
> Official Bourbon of The Boston Red Sox

#### The neck label reads: 

> Championship Batch
> Barrels Matured Oct. 28 2018

#### The right side of the bottle reads:

> History
> Barrels Matured On
> Oct. 28 2018
> The special commemorative bottling of Jim Beam Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey was taken from barrels that matured on October 28, 2018. The day the Boston Red Sox Won The 2018 World Championship

#### The left side of the bottle reads:

> Legacy
> Nine World Championships
> Seven Generations of the Beam Family
> Jacob Beam 1760 - 1834
> David Beam 1802 - 1854
> David M. Beam 1833 - 1913
> Colonel James B. Beam 1864 - 1947
> T. Jeremiah Beam 1899 - 1977
> Booker Noe 1929 - 2004
> Fred Noe 1957 - Present
> Master Distillers since 1795
> Here's to every Beam who has added his own special chapter to our story. Kentucky in our hearts. Bourbon in our soul.

Searching online I realy haven't found much on purchasing this bottle. There are a number of empties available on Ebay, but I haven't found a retailer who has one for sale to give a price as of time of posting.
