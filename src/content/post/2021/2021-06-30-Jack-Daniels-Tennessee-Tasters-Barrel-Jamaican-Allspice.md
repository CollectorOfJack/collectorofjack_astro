In the spring of 2020 Jack Daniel's released the sixth bottle in their [Tennessee Tasters' series](/series/tasters-distillery), Jamaican Allspice, Straight Tennessee Whiskey Finished with Toasted Jamaican Allspice Wood.

## The label reads:
> Our whiskey has found a home in countries all over the globe. So it's only natural that we search the world to discover new and rare woods to compliment its character. Tennessee Tasters' No. 6 is an exotic experiment that finishes our Old No. 7 whiskey with Jamaican Allspice wood. The result has a nose of fruit and smoke that melts into subtle, sweet tobacco and a taste that begins with dark spice and clove and lingers to finish long and bold.
> \- Master Taster: Melvin H. 

> Notes: Finished for 180 days
    
As with all the Tasters' Series these bottles were originally only available in Tennessee. I think you can still find it at the Distillery as of June 2021. 

**Release:** 2020  
**Proof:** 100
**Size:** 375ml  
**Price:** $42.99
