It appears as though the next "special release" bottle from Jack Daniel's will be available this fall as Jack Daniel's Coy Hill High Proof.

> Coy Hill High Proof Aged up in the "Buzzard's Roost" of our barrel houses on Coy Hill and bottled uncut at higher proofs.

> This special release series highlights our innovation in whiskey making here at Jack Daniel Distillery. Hand-selected from the highest parts of our barrel houses and bottled from single barrels, we extens this one-of-kind craftsmanship to you.

We look forward to this one!
