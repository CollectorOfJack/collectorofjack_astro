In the fall of 2019 Jack Daniel's released the fifth bottle in their [Tennessee Tasters' series]](/series/tasters-distillery), Barrel Reunion #2, Straight Tennessee Whiskey Finished in Oatmeal Stout Barrels.

## The label reads:
> Think of this as Jack Daniel's version of the Boilermaker; a Middle Tennessee craft brewery finished their oatmeal stout using our barrels. We explored further, bringing the empty barrels back to finish our Tennessee whiskey. The result is unique in chracter: Its nose, class Jack -- notes of vanilla and toasted oak. The stout provides a creamy texture, hints of oat, coffee and chocolate covered cherries. 
> \- Master Taster: Kevin Brent Smith

> Notes: Rested at least 240 days in beer barrels
    
As with all the Tasters' Series these bottles were originally only available in Tennessee. I think you can still find it at the Distillery as of June 2021. 

**Release:** 2019  
**Proof:** 92
**Size:** 375ml  
**Price:** $39.99
