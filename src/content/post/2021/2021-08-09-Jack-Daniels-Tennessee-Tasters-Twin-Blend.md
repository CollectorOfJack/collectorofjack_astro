The latest release in the [Tennessee Tasters' series](/series/tasters-distillery) is the 14E19 "Twin" Blend Whiskey. This particular release is from Fall 2020, and contains Straight Tennessee Whiskey blended with Straight Tennessee Rye Whiskey.

## The front label reads:
> Jack Daniel's Tennessee Tasters' Selection
> 14E19 "Twin" Blend | Whiskey
> Straight Tennessee Whiskey blended with Straight Tennessee Rye Whiskey
> 53.5% Alc. By Vol (107 Proof)

> Our master tasters - known by some around here as "Tennessee Tasters" - ensure the quality of our whiskey. This selection extends their exposure to you by sharing some of their personal favorite, previously unreleased expressions. Selection approved by: Chris Fletcher Master Distiller

## The rear/side label reads
> Notes: Barrel entry date of 14-e-19 20 barrents TN Whiskey 30 barrels TN Rye
> Selection No: 007
> Released: Fall 2020
> Twins might have completely different tastes, but because they share a birthday and family, their character complements one another. This is the secret behind Jack Daniel's 14E19 "Twin" Blend. We hand-selected 50 barrels of our Tennessee Whiskey and Tennessee Rye, all with a barrel entry date of May 19, 2014. Blended together and bottles at a flavorful 107 proof, "Twin" Blend complements Rye's spice with Tennessee Whiskey's sweet, floral accesnts for a doubly complex spirit. 
> Master Taster Jessica Hartline

You may or may not be able to find yourself a bottle of this. As with all the TN Tasters' series, it is a Tennessee only release, with with a limited total of 50 barrels used, there aren't many bottles out there. I was able to find a bottle for purchase around the Lynchburg area in early June 2021, but imagine that soon it will no longer be found.
