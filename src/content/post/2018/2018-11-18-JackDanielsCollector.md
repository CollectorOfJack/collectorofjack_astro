My name is [Chris Hammond](https://www.chrishammond.com/), I started my journey with Jack Daniel's at a young age. My father would have a Jack and Coke, every night after work. One and done, but as well as I can remember, it was a nightly ritual. I might have snuck a taste as a kid, but I wasn't a kid who drank in high school, it wasn't until college until I really had my first drink.

I was in a fraternity at a small engineering school in Missouri, it was in a small town, with a very skewed guy to girl ratio, so even though joining a fraternity had never crossed my mind prior to college, it made sense to me and built me into who I am today. While you might think there is a lot of drinking in a fraternity in college, it isn't required, and it was never forced upon me. So when I did sit down to have my first drink, it was to a great surprise to my fraternity brothers. I can still remember the room, there was a group of guys that were partaking in a 1/5th (750ml) of Old No. 7, I sat down one evening and asked for my own glass, they were floored.

I didn't plan to start drinking Jack Daniel's that evening, but I ended up doing so, and thus setting my journey into the world of Tennessee Whiskey. While I don't have the first bottle of Jack Daniel's I purchased, I do have a couple of bottles that I purchased during my college years. I wish I could go back in time and buy two or three, at the time I didn't buy to collect, so the bottles from back then are all empty, but they are still mine.

Why CollectorOfJack.com? I've been collecting Jack Daniel's bottles for many years now, and while I am proud of my collection, there are definitely some gaps that I would like to fill.

I've managed to acquire some extras over the years, and I'm hopeful that with this blog I'll be able to find other like minded folks, who perhaps have bottles to fill my gaps and possibly need some of the extras that I have in my collection.

So, grab a glass of Old No. 7, maybe some ice if that suits you, and take a look around here as I [document all things Jack Daniel's](/)!
