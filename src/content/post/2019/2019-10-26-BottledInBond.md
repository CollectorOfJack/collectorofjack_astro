Another Traveler's Exclusive released by Jack Daniel's in the last couple of years is the 100 Proof Bottled in Bond. I recently acquired one with the help of an employee who traveled to Europe in September. Only one was acquired, so I haven't had a change to taste it, but hopefully I can get another bottle some time in the future.


The bottle I got was a 1L in a box, let's document the box first. The front of the box reads:

> Jack Daniel's  
> Bottled at 100 Proof  
> Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey  
> Distilled and Vigilantly Bottled in Bond at the Jack Daniel Distillery  
> Traveler's Exclusive Bottled at A Hundred Proof

Both side's of the box read “Jack Daniel”. The rear has:

> Exacted Quality  
> Bottled in Bond  
> Jack Daniel's Bottled-in-bond is a rich, bold whiskey that honors the 1890s, the time when Mr. Jack began bottling whiskey in his signature square bottle. That era also marked when the United States Government passed the bottled-in-bond act.  
> The bottled-in-bond designation was only awarded to whiskey aged for at least four years, distilled during a single season, crafted at only one distillery and bottled at 100 proof. These efforts, even today, assure drinkers that the whiskey is of the highest standard of quality.  
> DSP-TENN-1 Lynchburg, Tennessee, USA  
> Bonded Quality - 1 Litre - 100 Proof - 50% Vol.

As for the bottle itself. The front reads:

> Jack Daniel's  
> Bottled at 100 Proof  
> Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey  
> Distilled and Vigilantly Bottled in Bond at the Jack Daniel Distillery  
> Traveler's Exclusive Bottled at One Hundred Proof  
> 1.0L 50% VOL.

On the sides the bottle reads:

> During the 1890s, Mr. Jack Daniel entrusted his whiskey to the now familiar square bottle to ensure its quality “Until the seal is broken.” The United States Government then followed suit by unveiling the Bottled-In-Bond Act identifying whiskey from a single distillery from a single season matured in a bonded barrelhouse and bottled at 100 Proof. This rich bold whiskey honors the spirit of both.  
> Distilled &amp; Bottled By Jack Daniel Distillery Lynchburg, Tenn. USA DSP-TENN-1

and:

> The Oldest Registered Distillery  
> Placed in the National Register of Historic Places by the United States Government  
> 1.0 L  
> Bottled at A Hundred Proof  
> Charcoal Mellowed Drop By Drop  
> Matured in Barrels of our own making  
> Every Barrel is Different Every Bottle Tastes The Same

The back reads:
  
> Made only in Lynchburg, Tennessee U.S.A.

This is a beautiful bottle, and box, as you can see in the photo gallery here on this page. I hope at some point in the future the distillery releases the bottle to normal retail markets as well, but only time will tell.
