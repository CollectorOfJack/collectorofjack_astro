in 1892 Jack Daniel opened the Red Dog Saloon on the Lynchburg town square. While nothing remains of it but legend, the distillery decided to release a 125th anniversary bottle in 2017 to celebrate the occasion.    
   
The bottle is adorned with black red white and gold decoration. One one side it reads:   

> THE RED DOG SALOON ESTABLISHED IN 1892 IS THE MORE MYSTERIOUS OF THE TWO JACK DANIEL'S ORIGINAL LYNCHBURG SALOONS. NO PHOTOGRAPHS OF IT EXIST BUT IF IT WAS ANYTHING LIKE ITS SISTER WATERING HOLE THE WHITE RABBIT SALOON THE HOUSE WAS PACKED WITH CORNET MUSIC CAMARADERIE AND CONVERSATION

On the other side it reads:   
> MR JACK NEVER DID ANYTHING HALFWAY. ESTD. 1866 OLD NO 7 BRAND. EVERYDAY WE MAKE IT, WE'LL MAKE IT THE BEST WE CAN. THAT WAS JACK'S MOTTO WHETHER IT CAME TO MAKING HIS SMOOTH SIPPIN WHISKEY OR MAKING A PLACE TO SERVE IT. TRUE TO MR. JACK'S TRADITION EVERY DROP IS STILL MADE IN LYUNCUBRG, TENNESSEE
   
The Red Dog Saloon bottle is easy to find, you can find them online as of 12/31/2018 for $27.
