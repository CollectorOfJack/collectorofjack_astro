In September of 2017 Jack Daniel's released their standard bottle of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye, their 70% rash mash bill. This is a more affordable version of the Rye from Jack Daniel's than the [Single Barrel Rye](/JackDanielsSingleBarrelRye) released in 2016.   

  
The bottle is your standard square bottle from Jack Daniel's, though the label has a tan background with black writing and green highlights. The front of the bottle reads:  
> Jack Daniel's     
> Barrel Aged   
> Rye  
> Moore CO.  


> Tennessee   
> Straight   
> Rye Whiskey  

> Distilled &amp; Bottled By  
> Jack Daniel Distillery  
> Lynchburg, Tenn USA  
> 45% ALC.Vol. (90 Proof)  
> Every Drop made in Lynchburg Tennessee  
> Quality and craftsmanship since 1866
  
The side of the bottle reads:  

> Jack Daniel's Tennessee Rye brings together two classics - rye's distinctive flavor, drawn from our unique 70% rye grain bill, and Jack's time-honored charcoal mellowing method. What emerges is a spicy whiskey that's sippin' smooth.   
> Jeff Arnett  
> Master Distiller  
> ”Every day we make it, we'll make it the best we can”  

  
The back adds:  

> Made only in   
> Lynchburg  
> Tennessee  
> U.S.A.  

  
While the other side reads:  
> Rye Grain  
> Hand Selected / Imparting a full  
> and spicy character  

> Mellowed  
> For smoothness / Drop by drop through  
> Sugar Maple Charcoal  
   
> Matured  
> For characters / In our own  
> Handcrafted Barrels  
  
Pictured in the photos here are both a 750ml and 1L bottle, only really differing in size and spacing of the content on the labels. These bottles can be found worldwide.  

**Release:** 2017
