In 2016, The Jack Daniel Distillery celebrated 150 years, in celebration of that milestone they released both a bottle that was easy to find, and a more collectible bottle, a 1 Liter bottle with a decorative black case. This post covers the more collectible bottle and box, and a future post will document the 750mL bottle.

The box black, folds open like a book, with gold lettering on the face and rear, while black embossing on the sides. The front reads:
> Jack Daniel's  
> 1866 - 150th - 2016  
> Anniversary  
> of the  
> Jack Daniel   
> Distillery
> A special  
> Tennessee Whiskey  
> Matured High On Coy Hill  

> Distilled &amp; Bottled By Jack Daniel Distillery Lynchburg, Tennessee

The back of the box reads:

> Jack Daniel's  
> 1866 - 150th - 2016  
> Anniversary  
> of the  
> Jack Daniel   
> Distillery

> IT WAS 150 YEARS AGO WHEN A YOUNG JACK DANIEL OF LYNCHBURG, TENNESSEE ESTABLISHED HIS WHISKEY DISTILLERY, WITH THE PROMISE THAT “eVERY DAY WE MAKE IT, WE'LL MAKE IT THE BEST WE CAN.”

> TO THIS DAY, WE HONOR MR. JACK'S FOUNDING WORDS, AND IN CELEBRATION OF THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE JACK DANIEL DISTILLERY WE HAVE CRAFTED THIS SPECIAL, LIMITED EDITION TENNESSEE WHISKEY.

> THIS 150TH ANNIVERSARY WHISKEY BRINGS TOGETHER THE BEST OF BOTH OUR DISTILLER'S AND COOPERS ' ART, AND WAS PERFECTLY MATURED BY MOTHER NATURE IN A BARREHOUSE HIGH ON COY HILL.

> BARRELED AND BOTTLED AT 100 PROOF; TAKE ONE SIP AND WE'RE SURE YOU'LL AGREE. THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO CELEBRATE.

> YOUR FRIENDS AT JACK DANIEL'S REMIND YOU TO DRINK RESPONSIBLY.

Inside the cover of the box reads:

> THIS SPECIAL JACK DANIEL'S TENNESSEE WHISKEY BRINGS TOGETHER THE BEST OF BOTH OUR DISTILLER'S AND COOPERS' ART.

> FIRST, OUR BARREL-MAKERS 'SLOW-TOASTED' THESE BARRELS TO BRING OUT THE RICH FLAVORS AND AROMAS OF THE WOOD, CREATING A CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSION OF AN 1866 BARREL CHAR.

> THEN, OUR MASTER DISTILLER BARRELED AND FINALLY BOTTLED THIS LIMITED EDITION JACK DANIEL'S TENNESSEE WHISKEY AT 100 PROOF, SO THAT ALL OF THE RICH FALVOR FINDS ITS WAY TO YOUR GLASS.

> THE RESULT IS A DELICIOUS, COMPLEX WHISKEY; A TASTE OF HISTORY IN THE MAKING.

> 1866 - 150 - 2016

In side the box you'll find the bottle, which is adorned with gold print and design, as well as a decal on the front with the volume and proof. The bottle is sealed with a golden topped cork, and a black ribbonish/decal. The front of the bottle reads:

> Jack Daniel's  
> 1866 - 150 - 2016  
> Anniversary  
> of the  
> Jack Daniel  
> Distillery

> A Special  
> Tennessee Whiskey  
> Matured High On Coy Hill  
> 50% Alc by vol / 100 Proof / 1 Liter

One side of the bottle reads:

> From 1866 to 2016  
> ”Every day we make it, we'll make it the best we can.”  
> Jack Daniel

The back of the bottle is blank, with the other-side of the bottle carrying a label with the standard government warning and the limited bottle number.

As of March 2019, you can find this bottle on a few websites, for around $150.
