In the last blog post I covered the [Jack Daniel's Tennessee Cider, Winter Jack, released in 2013](/WinterJack2013). Today's blog covers the same product, but this time with a new label. The front has the same text, Jack Daniel's Winter Jack, Original Recipe Tennessee Cider. Along with:   

> A seasonal blend of apple cider liqueur &amp; Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey   
   
This bottle has a very similar label to the bottle released in 2013, but this time around has a lighter colored (more grey than black) snow scene, with more gold accents around the label. The neck of the bottle, unlike the 2013 release, has a red white and gold label.   
 
The side of the bottle reads slightly different than the 2013 release:   

> Jack Daniel's Winter Jack is a seasonal blend made perfect with our apple cider liqueur, Jack Daniel's Old No.7 Tennessee Whiskey. An original recipe from Jack's home, Lynchburg Tennessee.   
   
The rear of the bottle reads:   

> Jack Daniel's Winter Jack Tennessee Cider  
> “Best Served Warm”   
> There is something special about every season in Lynchburg. Even the cold of winter has its own charm. We like to spend it gathered with family and friends, sharing a warm Tennessee Cider crafted from an original family recipe. Now, we are proud to share this tradition with you.
   
The other side of the bottle reads:   

> Made with original Jack Daniel's Old No. 7   
> Best served warm when it's cold > Share with friends and family
