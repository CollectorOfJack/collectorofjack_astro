In my previous blog post I talked about the [Tennessee Tasters'](/series/tasters-distillery) High Angel's Share Barrels, in this post I cover the second release in the series, Hickory Smoked. The bottle is labelled as "Tennessee Whiskey Finish with Charred Hickory Staves". 

> **Smoked Hickory Finish** - a fully matured whiskey finished with charred hickory staves for a smoky flavor at 100-proof, just in time for the 30<sup>th</sup> annual Jack Daniel's World Championship Invitational BBQ which is held in Lynchburg on Oct. 27. Selected by Master Taster Marsha Hale and available late-October.

This selection was from master taster Marsha Hale, whom according to her Linked In profile has worked at Jack Daniel's for almost 31 years. 

I have yet to decide if I will try these bottles myself. I do have two of each, with the original intention of keeping one and having the other for trading to fill my collection with missing items. If however I could come across some other bottles, I would likely try one out myself, only time will tell if that happens.

**Release**: October 2018  
**Proof**: 100  
**Size**: 375ml  
**Price**: $49
