In 2016 Jack Daniel's celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Jack Daniel's Distillery in Lynchburg, TN. They commemorated this with a special edition bottle in a black and gold label.
The front of the bottle reads:
> Jack Daniel's   
> 1866 150th 2016  
> Anniversary of the Jack Daniel Distillery  
> A Special 86 Proof Old No.7  
> Tennessee Whiskey  
> Distilled &amp; Bottled By  
> Jack Daniel Distillery  
> Lynchburg, Tennessee, USA  
> 43% Alc By Vol. (86 Proof)  

The right side of the bottle reads:

> This Special Eight-six Proof Old No.7 Is a Tribute to a Legacy of Whiskey Craftsmanship &amp; The Birthplace of an American Classic

The left side reads:
> The year 2016 Marks 150 Years of Jack Daniel Distillery The Oldest Registered Distillery in The United States of America  

I don't believe the bottle was limited in release, and was likely available in all 50 states. I haven't seen one on a shelf in quite a few years however. You can find it online for around $130.  


**Release:** 2016  
**Proof:** 86  
**Size:** 750ml  
**Price:** $24.99
