The 13th release in the Jack Daniel's [Distillery Series](/series/tasters-distillery), formerly Tennessee Tasters' has been announced, a Twice Barreled Rye. 

Information about this release is hard to find so far, but it is being reported that it will be available in April 2024, and as with all other bottles in the series, only available in Tennessee.

Here's what we know so far, mostly based on the label found online.

**Name**: Twice Barreled Tennessee Straight Rye Whiskey  
**Description**: A unique rye grain bill twice barreled in new, charred American white oak barrels for added depth and character.  
**Proof**: 107  
**Size**: 375ml  
**Selection** #: 013  
**Released**: April 2024  
**Selected by** Whiskey Taster, Jason Marski  

Extra time in a second, new charred oak barrel sets this Tennessee Rye Whiskey apart, with aromas of sweet smoke and burnt sugar on the nose.
