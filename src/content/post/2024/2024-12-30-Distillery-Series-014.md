These were released at the distillery on December 7th, just in time for the barrel tree lighting that night.

These bottles were purchased at the distillery, I was fortunate enough to have a friend grab them for me!

I'll do a full write up early next year for this release.

## How Much Is Jack Daniel's Distillery Series Twice Barreled Tennessee Straight Rye Whiskey
Originally priced around $45, you may still be able to find release 014 on shelves in Tennessee, most likely for $55+. It is also rumored to be one of the most limited releases from this series, so you might not find any!
 
### Collector Of Jack's Value Assessment
If you can find it for under $100 you should pick it up.
