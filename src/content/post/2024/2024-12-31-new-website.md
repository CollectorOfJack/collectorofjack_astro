I'll be honest, mentally I have had some roadblocks in place with this website for the past year or two. I wasn't super thrilled with the website design I had implemented, but never could get around to working on coming up with something else.

Well, today that roadblock has been flattened with the new launch of the site! Welcome to Collector of Jack 3.0! 

The website has been rebuilt from the ground up on [Astro](https://astro.build). All of the content has been migrated over to the new format and should still exist on the same URLs as before. 

With the new site I hope to motivate my photography and get back to regularly posting bottles. I've got quite the backlog from the past couple of years of things that haven't been properly cataloged and documented on the site! 

I've got some work to do on this new site, I need to flush out some additional information on the [Series](/series) pages for sure. I may make some additional tweaks to the photo galleries for the bottle catologing, we'll see how much I can make this new platform do. 

As always, if you're looking for that missing bottle, check out my [hunt list](/huntlist) where I display a list of items I am looking for, as well as items I have available for trade! 

The new website has a [Contact Form](/contact) in which you can reach out to me easily, to please don't hesitate!
