It appears that the Winter Jack release for 2024 has a new label! This is what I believe to the the third iteration of the label/product since it's initial release in 2013. [First Release](/WinterJack2013) [Second Release](/WinterJack)

What's different? Where it previously said "Tennessee Cider" the label now reads "Tennessee Spiced Apple Punch" 

### How did I get a bottle?
I found this bottle at Dogwood Wine and Spirits in Ellisville, MO back in September. It was mixed in with a number of the older label bottles still available on the shelf.  

## Front Label 

> A seasonal blend of apple cider liqueur &amp; Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey   
   
This bottle has the same label as that of the last release.
 
## Side Label 
The side of the bottle reads the same as the previous release:

> Jack Daniel's Winter Jack is a seasonal blend made perfect with our apple cider liqueur, Jack Daniel's Old No.7 Tennessee Whiskey. An original recipe from Jack's home, Lynchburg Tennessee.   
   
## Rear Label 
The rear of the bottle is slightly different from the previous release:

> Jack Daniel's Winter Jack Spiced Apple Punch 
> “Best Served Warm”   
> There is something special about every season in Lynchburg. Even the cold of winter has its own charm. We like to spend it gathered with family and friends, sharing a warm Tennessee Spiced Apple Punch crafted from an original family recipe. Now, we are proud to share this tradition with you.

## Side Label
   
The other side of the bottle reads:   

> Made with original Jack Daniel's Old No. 7   
> Best served warm when it's cold 
> Share with friends and family   
   

**Release:** 2024  
**Proof:** 30  
**Size:** 750ml  
**Price:** $24


## How Much Is Jack Daniel's Winter Jack Tennessee Spiced Apple Punch?
Originally priced around $24, you should still find it on shelves everywhere!
 
### Collector Of Jack's Value Assessment
Pick one up for your collection, and one to drink! Short term value on these is retail, long term value is TBD, but not likely very high.
