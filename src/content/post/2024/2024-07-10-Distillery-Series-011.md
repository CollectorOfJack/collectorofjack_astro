Released in July 2023, the Straight Tennessee Whiskey Finished In Añejo Tequila Barrels was the fourth in the renamed [Distillery Series](/series/tasters-distillery) and number 11 overall when including the Tennessee Taster's line.

This is a Tennessee Whiskey finished in previously used Añejo Tequila barrels. This technically is another Barrel Reunion as the barrels originally aged Jack Daniel's before the tequila, and then again to finish off this limited release.

### How did I get a bottle?
For this bottle, and 012 I managed to pick up 2 each myself in Tennessee on a recent trip, once again for an ice hockey tournament. I may have 2 more somewhere in Missouri from a guy who picked some up for me but I've never been able to connect with him to pay and get them!
