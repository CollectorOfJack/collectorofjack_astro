In today's post we cover one of Jack Daniel's latest releases, the Jack Daniel's Heroes Selection Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye. The Jack Daniel's Heroes Selection is a limited-edition whiskey series honoring military personnel. Each year, a veteran selects a unique barrel for release. The 2024 edition, chosen by U.S. Navy Veteran Melvin Keebler, features a Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye Whiskey with a mash bill of 70% rye, 18% corn, and 12% malted barley. Bottled at 125-140 proof, it offers rich caramel and toasted oak flavors with complex spices. Priced at $69.99, it is available at select military retail locations and supports Jack Daniel's initiatives like the Operation Ride Home campaign for military families.

### How did I get a bottle?
I was able to pick this bottle up from a U.S. Military member who purchased it at a local military installation.
