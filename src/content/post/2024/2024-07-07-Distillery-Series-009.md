Also released in July 2022, this second rye released in the Distillery Series, the Straight Tennessee Rye Whiskey Finished In High Toast Oak Barrels, part of the [Jack Daniel's Distillery Series](/series/tasters-distillery).

Release 009 is another release of a Rye Whiskey from Jack Daniel's this time finished in a high toast oak barrel, in addition to the usual charred oak barrel that most of Jack Daniels whiskeys are aged in. 

### How did I get a bottle?
As with the 008 release, I picked this bottle up after a hockey tournament in Louisville Kentucky. After we finished up the tournament my son and I drove south to Tennessee. I was fortunate enough to come across a store who had bottles of releases 008, 009 and 010 that I picked up for retail! I stopped at 3 or 4 more stores on the way around Nashville back to Highway 24 and didn't find any more along the way.
