With the [2023 F1 Season](/JackDanielsMcLaren) Jack Daniel's joined McLaren as a sponsor of their F1 program. For 2024 that relationship continues and with that we have a 2024 bottle! (2025 Jack Daniel's x McLaren labels have recently popped up online as well)

Here's some of the information that was provided for marketing material last year related to the release.

## A Limited Edition Collectible

To celebrate this partnership, a limited edition bottle of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey has been released. This collectible bottle not only celebrates the collaboration but also honors the pioneering founders of each brand, Mr. Jack Daniel and Bruce McLaren. The bottle features the distinctive papaya colorway of McLaren, along with a customized label and packaging, making it a must-have for enthusiasts of both whiskey and motorsports.

## A Toast to Future Success

As part of a broader multi-year sponsorship agreement, this partnership aligns Jack Daniel's—one of the world’s best-selling whiskeys—with the high-performance and international prestige of the McLaren Formula 1 team. Fans of motorsports and whiskey alike can look forward to a variety of events, media, and hospitality programs throughout the 2023 F1 season.

## Bottle Information
As you can see from our photo gallery here the bottle and box have been updated from the 2023 version with more striking orange stripes dominating both the bottle and box. Here are some additional details about the bottle and box.

### The front of the box reads:
> Old No. 7 Brand  
> Jack Daniel's  
> McL X JD 2024 Edition  
> Tennessee Whiskey  

> McLaren Formula 1 Team  
> Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 Brand  
> Official Partner

### The sides of the box read:
> McLXJD 2024 Edition
> Never Drink & Drive.  

### The rear of the box reads:
> Jack Daniel & McLaren Racing  
> Two iconic brands that share a  
> forever forward philosophy, above
> everything else.  

> As Jack always said: "Every day we  
> make it, we'll make it the best we can."  
> And that is as true today as it was  
> back then.  

### The front of the bottle reads:
> Old No. 7 Brand  
> Jack Daniel's  
> McL X JD 2024 Edition

### One side of the bottle reads:

> forward philosophy, above everything else. 

> As Jack always said: "Every day we make it,  
> we'll make it the best we can." and that is as  
> true today as it was back then.

### The other side of the bottle reads:
> McLaren Formula 1 Team  
> Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 Brand

## Where to find the Jack Daniel's / McLaren Racing Formula 1 2023 Bottle
These bottles, unlike the 2023 release, appear to have been released to a much wider set of retailers. COJ was able to find it here in Missouri where they definitely were not sold in MO in 2023. 

**Release:** 2024  
**Proof:** 80  
**Size:** 1L  
**Price:** $45


## How Much Is Jack Daniel's / McLaren Racing Formula 1 Worth?
If you can find it in one of the states that it is sold, definitely don't pay more than retail. If you're shopping elsewhere be prepared to pay a little more.
 
### Collector Of Jack's Value Assessment
Grab one and hold on to it, years from now they'll be worth a few bucks.
