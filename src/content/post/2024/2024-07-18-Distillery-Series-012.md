Released in December 2023, the Straight Tennessee Whiskey Finished In Oloroso Sherry Casks was the fifth in the renamed [Distillery Series](/series/tasters-distillery) and number 12 overall when including the Tennessee Taster's line.

This is a Tennessee Whiskey finished in previously used Oloroso Sherry casks. This whiskey was first aged in charred American white oak, then for another 3 years in Oloroso Sherry Casks.

### How did I get a bottle?
For this bottle I managed to pick up 2 myself in Tennessee on a recent trip, once again for an ice hockey tournament.
