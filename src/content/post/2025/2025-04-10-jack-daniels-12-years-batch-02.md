This post covers another one of the [age statement release series](/series/aged-releases) of releases from Jack Daniel's, specifically the first, Batch 02, of the 12 Years Old release of Jack Daniel's.

The second batch of the 12 Year Release differs very little from the initial [Batch 01](/2025/12yearsbatch01), the only variation on the label being the notation of Batch 02, and a shortened sediment message on the rear. 

### How did I get a bottle?
I picked one of these up from a local guy that had it listed on a secondary marketplace. The other I don't recall the source of currently. This is a case of me not documenting my collection properly and acquiring 2 unintentionally.
