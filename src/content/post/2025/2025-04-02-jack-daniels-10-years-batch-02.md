This post covers another one of the [age statement release series](/series/aged-releases) of releases from Jack Daniel's, specifically batch 02 of the 10 Years Old release of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey.

This bottle is the first of the aged statement bottles that is released in the 700ml size instead of the 750ml that Batch 01 was released in.

### How did I get a bottle?
I managed to get my first bottle of Batch 02 via a buddy who picked it up at a local liquor store here outside of St. Louis, MO.
