Here we've got another whiskey that isn't from the Jack Daniel's brand, but has some ties back to the brand through the country singer [Eric Church](/tag/eric-church).

This is the first release from Eric Church's Whiskey Jypsi brand. It is a blend of 3 different whiskeys, noted with specifics on the back label of the bottle. It is 70% Bourbon, 21% Canadian Rye and 9% American Single Malt. It was distilled in both Indiana and Canada, and finished, blended and bottled in Morrison, Tennessee. 

### How did I get a bottle?
This is one of my most interesting stories that I can share about bottles in my whiskey collection. I've tracked Eric Church's whiskey journey for a few years through his Jack Daniel's releases. When this new brand, Whiskey Jypsi was announced I was excited to get my hands on a bottle. I also started looking around and realize they didn't have the Twitter handle for Whiskey Jypsi. Being an entrepenurual person, I went out and grabbed that twitter handle. I tweeted out from it maybe a handful of times.

Eventually someone reached out to me inquiring about the handle, claiming to represent the brand. After doing a little google and linked in searching I was fairly comfortable that this person was actually part of the brand. We setup a phone call and had a very casual conversation. I mentioned that I would be willing to hand over the account to the brand, and they offerd up a trade for the handle. I was able to get this bottle in exchange for the account!
