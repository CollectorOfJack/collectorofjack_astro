Diverging away from Jack Daniel's for a minute we'll be covering a bottle I picked up here in St. Louis sometime last year (2024). This bottle is a limited edition release from Maker's Mark celebrating the Super Bowl Champion Kansas City Chiefs (at the time of purchase, they were the current 2x champions). 


## How did I get a bottle?
I picked up this bottle at a local gas station! I eventually saw them at a local Total Wine & More as well, but I haven't seen them on the shelf in the past 5 months.


## Bottle Details
The bottle appears to be a pretty standard Maker's Mark bottle, though the label is a vanilla color with red black and gold printing on it. The obligatory Maker's Mark wax is a bright yellow to fit with one of the Chiefs colors.

### Front Of The Bottle Reads
> Maker's Mark  
> Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whisky  
> Champions  
> KC (chiefs logo)  
> Limited Edition  
> 750mL - 45% ALC./VOL.  

### One Side Of The Bottle
> Countless hours of hard work, attention to detail and an unwavering passion every season. This level of dedication is what it takes to be the best. That's why at Maker's Mark, we hand-rotate every barrel, hand-dip every bottle, print and hand-cut every label (just like this one) and meticulously age our whisky to taste, not time. This season, we are proud to bring our best to your community as a proud partner of your Kansas City Chiefs.

### Other Side Of The Bottle
The Chiefs have gone back to back, claiming a fourth championship! As you raise another banner in KC, we raise a glass to one thrilling season. Chiefs Kingdom always fights for its right. And we're definitely here for that party. May this bottle win a place in your trophy case. Or crack it open and savor the sweet taste of victory. Cheers. Proud Partner of the Kansas City Chiefs

The Back Of The Bottle doesn't contain any specific labeling for the limited edition release.
