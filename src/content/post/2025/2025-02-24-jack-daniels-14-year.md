This morning Jack Daniel's [posted on their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/jackdaniels/posts/pfbid0d1ix5VNMtF87Hv1om4CLXv1woFfLa8Rh1rS6hBNHqjkfRfDHRSFTosUGPWbWFoKMl) about their release of Jack Daniel's 14 Year. 

> Introducing Jack Danielâ€™s 14-Year - the first whiskey of this age to be released from Jack Daniel Distillery in over 100 years. Using the same recipe and process as Old No. 7 with some extra time in the barrel to produce something truly special. Flavors of cinnamon and creamy butterscotch balanced with rich leather prove that some things are worth the wait & limited in quantity.

Via other Facebook groups it appears that this 14 year bottle is available today at the White Rabbit Bottle Shop at the Distillery in Lynchburg Tennessee, along with a few other bottles.

 - 10 Year Batch 4
 - 12 Year Batch 3
 - McLaren 2025

 If anyone pickes up a bottle or two of those for me, let me know!
