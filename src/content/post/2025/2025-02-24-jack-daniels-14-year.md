This post has been updated with official Collector Of Jack photos of the 14 Years Old release from Jack Daniel's.

In the third release of the [age statement release series](/series/aged-releases) from Jack Daniel's we have the first 14 Years Old release of Jack Daniel's. This bottle has proved to be one of the most limited of the aged releases from Jack Daniel's thus far. Below we will document the details about the bottle.

### How did I get a bottle?
I was able to locate this bottle at a small liquor store in Ringgold Tennessee, Ringgold Fine Wine & Spirits. They had the 14 Years Old release, along with the 12 Years Old Batch 3 release. I was able to package them up for a deal that I was comfortable with.

## Where to find Jack Daniel's 14 Years Old Tennessee Whiskey
Good luck, this is one of the hardest to find bottles. You'll need to ask your liquor store clerk if they have it in stock. Many stores will keep this one behind the counter and possibly not even on display. 

**Release:** 2025  
**Proof:** 126.3  
**Size:** 700ml  
**Price:** $149    

## How Much Is Jack Daniel's 14 Years Old Tennessee Whiskey
Originally priced around $149, you will be hard pressed to find it anywhere near that price. 
 
### Collector Of Jack's Value Assessment
If you can find it for under $500 pick it up, but you'll more than likely be expected to pay north of $700 for a bottle

## Original post from February 24, 2025
This morning Jack Daniel's [posted on their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/jackdaniels/posts/pfbid0d1ix5VNMtF87Hv1om4CLXv1woFfLa8Rh1rS6hBNHqjkfRfDHRSFTosUGPWbWFoKMl) about their release of Jack Daniel's 14 Year. 

> Introducing Jack Danielâ€™s 14-Year - the first whiskey of this age to be released from Jack Daniel Distillery in over 100 years. Using the same recipe and process as Old No. 7 with some extra time in the barrel to produce something truly special. Flavors of cinnamon and creamy butterscotch balanced with rich leather prove that some things are worth the wait & limited in quantity.

Via other Facebook groups it appears that this 14 year bottle is available today at the White Rabbit Bottle Shop at the Distillery in Lynchburg Tennessee, along with a few other bottles.

 - [12 Year Batch 3](/2025/12yearsbatch03)  
 - McLaren 2025  

 If anyone pickes up a bottle or two of those for me, let me know!
