Another diversion from Jack Daniel's, but keeping it in the Brown-Forman family, we've got the 151st Kentucky Derby Kentucky Bourbon from Woodford Reserve. 

This is the 5th or 6th Kentucky Derby bottle I've acquired over the past just as many years. 

The 2025 **Woodford Reserve Kentucky Derby 151** bottle is a limited-edition release that honors the rich legacy of the "Greatest Two Minutes in Sports." As the Presenting Sponsor of the Kentucky Derby, Woodford Reserve has released special commemorative bottles annually since 1999 — and this year's edition is no exception.

## A Work of Art

The Derby 151 bottle features vibrant artwork from **Humberto Lahera**, a Cuban-born, Louisville-based artist. His painting, titled *Carrera Dinamica* ("Dynamic Race"), brings the high-energy spirit of the Derby to life with expressive brushstrokes, fluid motion, and bold colors. It’s a visual celebration of the excitement and tradition that defines Derby Day.

## The Bourbon

Inside the beautifully decorated bottle is Woodford Reserve’s signature **Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey**, bottled at **90.4 proof (45.2% ABV)**. Expect a rich and balanced profile:

- **Nose:** Dark fruit, caramel, sharp honey, chocolate, marzipan, and toasted oak.
- **Palate:** Full-bodied with vanilla, dark caramel, hazelnut, apple, and spice.
- **Finish:** Long and creamy with lingering notes of honeyed apple.

### How did I get a bottle?
I picked up this bottle from my local Total Wine in April 2025.
