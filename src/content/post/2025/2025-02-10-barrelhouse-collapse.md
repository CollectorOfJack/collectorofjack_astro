This morning news appears to be breaking that Jack Daniel's has had a barrelhouse collapse in the hills around Lynchburg Tennessee.


> @10:43 a.m. | We now have an official statement from Brown-Forman. "Overnight, there was a partial collapse of a Jack Daniel Distillery barrel house in Lynchburg, TN. No individuals were inside the barrel house at the time and there were no injuries to any employees. We are working with distillery and local officials to assess the damage," according to Svend Jansen, Jack Daniel's Global Public Relations Director.

I saw it first on the [BarrelHouse107](https://www.facebook.com/Barrelhouse107) Facebook page (picture above from their post) and then also on [The Lynchburg Times](https://www.facebook.com/lynchburgtimes) facebook page.

> reports of a partial warehouse collapse behind the Jack Daniel's South Bottling Plant on Monday morning at around 5:40 a.m

> Here's what we've been able to confirm: It happened at a older warehouse. There were no injuries. Some whiskey spilled but not a large volume.

I will update this post as more info is established.
