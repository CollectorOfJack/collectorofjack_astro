Here we've got a bottle of Jack Daniel's that you originally could find on just about any store shelf in many states, and now you'll be hard pressed to find it at retail anywhere in the world ever again. The Jack Daniel's Green Label, this one is in the Evo bottle.

## What is Jack Daniel's Green Label?
Jack Daniel's Green Label is a less common and milder version of their signature Old No. 7 Tennessee Whiskey.

## Is Jack Daniel's Green Label Discontinued?
This question is a hard one to answer if you're simply searching around online. I've seen in multiple groups, forums, etc, statements that say Green Label is no longer produced/distributed. But in other places I see it is available in 5 select states. 

My current belief, and opinion, is that it is no longer being produced, and any availability you find is simply the remnants of what was produced in the past. 

**Why do I have this opinion?** I have asked folks at Jack Daniel's and this is what they have told me.

I have a 375ml bottle I will document in the future that I purchased here in Missouri in the last 5 years. 

### Key Characteristics

- **Same Mash Bill**: 
  - 80% corn, 12% barley, 8% rye â€” identical to Old No. 7.
- **Shorter Maturation**: 
  - Aged in the **lower levels** of the barrelhouses, where temperature swings are more stable, leading to a lighter whiskey.
- **Lower Proof (Historically)**: 
  - Often bottled at **80 proof**, though this can vary by market and year.
- **Limited Availability**: 
  - Produced in **smaller batches** with **regional releases**, making it a rarity in some areas.

### Taste Profile

- Lighter and smoother than Old No. 7
- Less oak and charcoal influence
- More grain-forward, mellow character

### Fun Fact

Jack Daniel's Green Label is often sought after by collectors due to its limited availability and slightly different flavor profile.

### Where was Green Label available?
 - New York  
 - New Jersey  
 - Pennsylvania  
 - Texas  
 - Tennessee  

### How did I get a bottle?
I don't know that I have the source of this bottle documented. I imagine I picked it up in Tennessee at some point in the last decade.
