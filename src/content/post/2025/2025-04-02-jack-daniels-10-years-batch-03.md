This post covers another one of the [age statement release series](/series/aged-releases) of releases from Jack Daniel's, specifically Batch 03 of the 10 Years Old release of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey.


### How did I get a bottle?
I have a couple of Batch 03 bottles in my collection. At least one purchased from a store after forgetting that I already had one. Proper documentation folks, I got away from keeping my inventory updated, don't be me!

## Front Of The Bottle Reads
> Jack Daniel's  
> 10 Years Old  
> Tennessee Whiskey   
> Distilled and Bottled By    
> Jack Daniel Distillery  
> Lynchburg, Tennessee, USA  
> Est. & Reg. in 1866
> 97 Proof  
> Batch 03  
> 48.5 %Alc/Vol  

## The Sides Of The Bottle
> Limited Release   

The back label differs a little from Batch 02 in that it doesn't make mention of using minimum filtration, but does still mention the possibility of sediment.
## Back Of The Bottle
> Aged 10 Years  
> Maturing whiskey for more than 150 years gives us the knowledge necessary to slowly rest our Tennessee Whiskey through 10 summers. We think you'll agree, it's worth the wait.
> Chris Fletcher Master Distiller  
> Sediment may occur over time.

## Where to find Jack Daniel's 10 Years Old Tennessee Whiskey Batch 03
You likely won't find this on the shelf at liquor stores anymore. You'll need to ask your liquor store clerk if they have it in stock. Many stores will keep this one, and the other age statement releases, behind the counter and possibly not even on display. 

**Release:** 2024  
**Proof:** 97  
**Size:** 700ml  
**Price:** $89  

## Flavor Notes
Notes of warm butterscotch and soft fruit

## How Much Is Jack Daniel's 10 Years Old Tennessee Whiskey Batch 03
Originally priced around $89, you will be hard pressed to find it anywhere near that price. You'll find these going for $150-225 on the secondary market.
 
### Collector Of Jack's Value Assessment
If you can find it for under $175 pick it up.
