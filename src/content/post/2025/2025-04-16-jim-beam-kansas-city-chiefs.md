Have you figured out who my favorite football team is yet? Yes, it's the Kansas City Chiefs! Here we have another special KC Chiefs bourbon, this time from Jim Beam, with their Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey for the 6X Division Champions.

This bottle came out in 2022 to limited markets to celebrate the Kansas City Chiefs! The whiskey doesn't appear to be unique, regular 80 proof Jim Beam, but the label and wrapping on the bottle are a celebration to the Chiefs.
