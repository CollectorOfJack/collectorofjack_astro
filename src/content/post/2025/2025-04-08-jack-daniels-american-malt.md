Here we have another special bottle from Jack Daniel's, Jack Daniel's American Single Malt. This is only the second time they've released a malt that I am aware of. The first time was the [2022 Special Release](/twicebarreledamericanmalt) which wasn't easy to get and easily went for north of $250 on the secondary market. This time around the Jack Daniel's American Single Malt is a little more available, though only in very limited markets! 

Jack Daniel's American Single Malt is only available in some travel shops (Duty Free) and on U.S. Military installations. 

The bottle is a fairly patriotic Blue and Dark Red with White lettering, making for an awesome look to add to your collection. The bottle itself appears to be unique in its features, being overall similarly shaped to the recent [bonded](/series/bonded) series but with some additional fluting on the glass to make it unique.

### How did I get a bottle?
I was fortunate enough to have a friend pick up this bottle of Jack Daniel's American Single Malt while he was travelling. He went to Europe and brought it back for me.

## Where to find Jack Daniel's American Single Malt
You're going to need to either enlist, or go overseas to get one of these bottles! When I asked folks at the Distillery back in March 2025 if this would become a wider release in the future, I wasn't given a promising answer.

**Release:** 2023  
**Proof:** 90  
**Size:** 1L  
**Price:** $89   

## Flavor Notes
Dark chocolate-covered nuts and berries with subtle Oloroso Sherry finish

## How Much Is Jack Daniel's American Single Malt
Originally priced around $89, you will be hard pressed to find it anywhere near that price if you find it secondary. You can expect to pay north of $125 for a bottle.
