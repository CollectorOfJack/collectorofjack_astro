## Celebrating Five Years of CollectorOfJack.com

Today, November 18, 2023, marks a special milestone for us at CollectorOfJack.com. It's been exactly five years since we launched our website in its first iteration back on November 18, 2018. We've come a long way since then, and we're excited to continue sharing our passion for Jack Daniel's with you. While posts have been infrequent lately, our founder Chris Hammond is committed to ramping up the content. Expect to see more frequent updates, with the aim of bringing you new and exciting content at least once a week!

## A Blend of Heritage and High Performance
Tonight (tomorrow morning really) is the Formula 1 race in Las Vegas, today's post is in honor of that hopefully great event!

**Lynchburg, Tennessee** – In a groundbreaking move, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey and McLaren Racing have announced a multi-year partnership, starting in 2023. This collaboration marks the first venture of Jack Daniel’s, a brand steeped in over 155 years of whiskey crafting heritage, into the high-octane world of Formula 1 racing.

## A New Look on the Track

Jack Daniel's iconic branding will be prominently displayed on the nose of McLaren’s 2023 Formula 1 cars. Additionally, the brand's logos will adorn the drivers' overalls and the helmets of the pit crew, integrating the whiskey brand's identity into the dynamic and globally followed sport of Formula 1 racing.

## A Limited Edition Collectible

To celebrate this partnership, a limited edition bottle of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey has been released. This collectible bottle not only celebrates the collaboration but also honors the pioneering founders of each brand, Mr. Jack Daniel and Bruce McLaren. The bottle features the distinctive papaya colorway of McLaren, along with a customized label and packaging, making it a must-have for enthusiasts of both whiskey and motorsports.

## A Toast to Future Success

As part of a broader multi-year sponsorship agreement, this partnership aligns Jack Daniel's—one of the world’s best-selling whiskeys—with the high-performance and international prestige of the McLaren Formula 1 team. Fans of motorsports and whiskey alike can look forward to a variety of events, media, and hospitality programs throughout the 2023 F1 season.
