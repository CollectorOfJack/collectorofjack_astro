The 2023 Special Release from Jack Daniel's brings us another heritage barrel selection, and another twice barreled offering ([like 2022](/TwiceBarreledAmericanMalt)) at the same time. 

This year's edition is a Rye, first barreled in new oak barrels, then followed up with a second maturing session in some extra toasty heritage barrels. 

These 700ml bottles are bottled at 100 proof. 

## From the Jack Daniel's Website
> A SPECIAL TWIST ON OUR ORIGINAL HERITAGE BARREL EXPRESSION
> The Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Special Release series highlights an annual limited innovation from the Jack Daniel Distillery and this year’s release is a twist on the original -- Heritage Barrel. Twice Barreled Heritage Barrel Rye is a celebration of the whiskey-making traditions of our distillery and the barrel-making expertise of our cooperage. The 2023 Jack Daniel’s Special Release is a one-of-a-kind experience crafted from 70% rye, 18% corn, and 12% malted barley and twice barreled for a complex taste.


As with the heritage bottles lately, the labels are primarly screen printed on the bottle, with some paper label at the bottom on the front, and the rear (actually side) label is also paper.

## Front Label
> Jack Daniel's  
> Uniquely Crafted Handmade Barrels  
> Twice Barreled  
> Special Release  
> Tennessee Rye Whiskey  
### Paper Label
> Straight Rye Whiskey aged in new oak barrels and then matured in our handmade heritage barrels which are heavily toasted and lightly charred to create a unique flavor.
> 100 Proof | 50% ALC/Vol | 700ml 

The back/side label is paper and reads:

## Side/Back Label
> Limited Bottle No. HBR-#####  
> This special release series highlights the Jack Daniel Distillery's innovation. Our rye whiskey is matured in new American charred oak barrels and then in our uniquely crafted heavy-toast, low-char, heritage barrels. We extend this one-of-a-kind craftsmanship to you.
