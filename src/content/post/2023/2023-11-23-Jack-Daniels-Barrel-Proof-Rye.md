Jack Daniel's ventured into Rye over 10 years ago and has regularly been adding to their line since. 

In 2023 Jack Daniel's started bottling and releasing their Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye, to go along with their Single Barrel Barrel Proof Tennessee Whiskey. This will be regular release going forward. 

On the initial release it has been difficult to find on the shelves, but in the past couple of years, Single Barrel Barrel Proof Tennesse Whiskey has been hard to come by as well.

The barrel is the typical Jack Daniel's single barrel bottle, with the gold label that you should be familiar with. The print on the labels are in green, versus the usual black for the normal barrel proof. The neck contains a green label with the barrel number, bottling date, and the knob on the cork is the usual black with the Jack Daniel's logo on it.

The bottom label on the front reads RYE and has a green background where the proof and volume are listed.

I wish I paid retail for my first bottle, but I didn't. I found this bottle in Nashville, TN in June 2023. I paid about 2x retail, but it was the first one I had found, and was a very high proof at 139.3.

Have you found a bottle of the Barrel Proof Rye yet? Keep looking, it should be available pretty much anywhere you can find the Barrel Proof Tennessee Whiskey!

Here are two previous Barrel Proof Ryes released by Jack Daniel's.

## How Much Is Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye Worth?
Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Barrel Proof Rye is worth retail price. You shouldn't really be paying more than retail for this bottle as it is a regular release. Higher proofs might draw a little more value, but not too much.

### Collector Of Jack's Value Assessment
A great bottle to own, go for the higher proofs you can find, or bottls with specific bottling dates that are important to you.
